        <p>
          As i recently graduated as a graduate developer, i'll be mostly showing my work from
          school.
        </p>
        <p>Altough these are project for school, they are made with great passion.</p>
        <p>
          Mostly schoold as back-end, my experience is mostly focussed in c# en .NET Framework but i
          love to combine this with some front-end.
